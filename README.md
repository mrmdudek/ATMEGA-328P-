# ATMEGA-328P-9bit UART and MAX485 transceivers

Objective â€“ Development of an asynchronous communication system composed by several nodes. Those nodes have the same hardware and should be based in the ATmega328P MCU and MAX485 transceivers. 

Each node must have a LED connected to the MCU that will be used in the final demonstration where the Master will switch each LED of the connected Slaves in a sequential order. For that each node is addressed with a set of 4 DIP switches.
